# Here's an example of a code snippet using Python to connect to a MySQL database and perform a simple query:

import mysql.connector

# Connect to the MySQL database
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  password="yourpassword",
  database="yourdatabase"
)

# Create a cursor object to interact with the database
cursor = mydb.cursor()

# Execute a SQL query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM yourtable")

# Fetch all the rows from the result
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the rows
for row in results:
  print(row)

# Close the cursor and database connection
cursor.close()
mydb.close()


# In this code snippet, you need to provide the appropriate values for the `host`, `user`, `password`, `database`, and `yourtable` variables.
# Make sure to install the `mysql-connector-python` package before running the code.

# The code establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the provided credentials.
# It then creates a cursor object that allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch the results.
# In this example, a SELECT query is executed to fetch all the rows from a table. The rows are printed one by one.

# Finally, the cursor and database connection are closed to release the resources.

# Please ensure that you have a MySQL server running and the necessary privileges and credentials to connect to the database.
