# This is a Dockerfile that defines the build process for a Docker image. Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

# The FROM instruction specifies the base image to use for the build. In this case, it is the official Python 3.9 image.

# The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile.

# The COPY instruction copies files from the host machine to the container’s file system.

# The RUN instruction runs a command in the container’s file system. In this case, it installs the Python packages listed in requirements.txt.

# The CMD instruction specifies the command to run when a container based on this image is started. In this case, it runs the app.py script using Python.
