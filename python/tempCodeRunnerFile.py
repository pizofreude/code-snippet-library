In this code snippet, we define a function `bubble_sort` that takes an array `arr` as input and performs the bubble sort algorithm on it.

# The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the entire array is sorted.
# The outer loop iterates `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the array. The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order.

# After sorting the array, we demonstrate the usage of the `bubble_sort` function by sorting an example array `numbers`. The sorted array is then printed to the console.

# This code snippet serves as a starting point to learn about algorithms and data structures in Python.
# You can explore more complex algorithms and data structures and implement them in Python to further deepen your understanding.
