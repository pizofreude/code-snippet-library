# Here's a Python code snippet that demonstrates the implementation of a linked list data structure:


class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def insert_at_end(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)

        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node

    def display(self):
        current = self.head

        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

# Example usage
linked_list = LinkedList()
linked_list.insert_at_end(10)
linked_list.insert_at_end(20)
linked_list.insert_at_end(30)
linked_list.display()


# In this code snippet, we define two classes: `Node` and `LinkedList`.
# The `Node` class represents a single node in the linked list, which contains a `data` attribute and a `next` attribute pointing to the next node in the list.
# The `LinkedList` class represents the linked list itself.

# The `LinkedList` class provides two methods:
# - `insert_at_end(data)`: Inserts a new node with the given data at the end of the linked list.
# - `display()`: Displays the elements of the linked list.

# We demonstrate the usage of the `LinkedList` class by creating a linked list object, inserting elements at the end, and displaying the linked list.
# In this example, we insert the values 10, 20, and 30 at the end of the linked list and then display the linked list.

# Linked lists are fundamental data structures that can be used for various applications.
# By exploring and implementing different operations on linked lists, such as insertion, deletion, or searching,
# we can gain a deeper understanding of linked list data structure concepts and their practical use in algorithms and data manipulation.
