def add(a, b):

# Unit test
assert add(2, 3) == 5

# This is Python code that defines a function that adds two numbers and returns the result.

# The `def` keyword is used to define a new function.

# The name of the function is `add`.

# The `a` and `b` parameters are used to pass in two numbers.

# The `return` statement returns the sum of the two numbers.

# The `assert` statement checks that calling the `add` function with arguments 2 and 3 returns 5. If the assertion fails, an error will be raised.

# This is an example of a unit test for the `add` function.
