# This is Python code that uses the Pygame library to create a game window and run a game loop.

# The `import` statement imports the `pygame` module.

# The `pygame.init()` function initializes Pygame.

# The code creates a game window and enters a game loop that runs until the user closes the window.

# The `for` loop processes events in the Pygame event queue. If the user clicks the close button on the window, the game loop exits.

# The game state is updated and game objects are rendered in the appropriate sections of the game loop.

# The `pygame.display.update()` function updates the display with any changes made during the current frame.
