### Pull Request and Commit Message

Having a standardized commit message format can greatly streamline the version control and collaboration process.

Here's a suggested commit message format that you can take as a guideline:

```arduino
Commit Message Format:
<directory>: <brief description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Here's a breakdown of each part:

*   `<directory>`: The directory or module name where the changes are made. For example, `algorithms`, `backend-dev`, `css`, etc. This helps in quickly identifying the scope of the changes.
    
*   `<brief description>`: A concise summary of the changes made in the commit. It should provide enough information to understand the purpose or nature of the changes.
    
*   `[optional body]`: An optional section where you can provide more details about the changes. This can include any additional context, explanations, or notable points related to the commit.
    
*   `[optional footer]`: Another optional section where you can include any relevant information such as references to issues, pull requests, or other related commits.
    

Here's an example of a commit message using this format:

```sql
algorithms: Add binary search implementation

- Implemented binary search algorithm in Python
- Included an example usage in the README

Closes #25
```

Using this format consistently across your commits will make it easier for collaborators to understand the changes made and track the progress of the project.
