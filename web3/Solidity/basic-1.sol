// Here's a basic code snippet in Solidity to get you started:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleContract {
    uint public myNumber;

    constructor() {
        myNumber = 0;
    }

    function setNumber(uint _newNumber) public {
        myNumber = _newNumber;
    }
}

// This Solidity code defines a simple smart contract called `SimpleContract`. The contract has a state variable `myNumber` of type `uint` (unsigned integer).
// The initial value of `myNumber` is set to 0 in the constructor.

// The contract also includes a public function `setNumber` that allows you to update the value of `myNumber` by passing a new number as an argument.

// To learn Solidity from basic to advanced, it's important to understand the fundamentals of smart contracts, data types, control structures, and function modifiers.
// You can gradually expand your knowledge by exploring more complex concepts such as inheritance, interfaces, events, and mappings.

// To deepen your understanding:
// - experiment with deploying and interacting with smart contracts on a local development blockchain
// - test networks like Ropsten or Rinkeby. 
// - Solidity's official documentation, tutorials, and online resources like Ethereum's Solidity documentation ([https://docs.soliditylang.org](https://docs.soliditylang.org))
// - Solidity's Remix IDE ([https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)) are excellent sources for learning and practicing Solidity.

// Remember to always test and deploy smart contracts carefully, as they involve real value transactions on the blockchain.
