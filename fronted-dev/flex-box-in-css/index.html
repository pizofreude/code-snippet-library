<!-- Here's an example of a code snippet that direct HTML to reference an external CSS to demonstrate the use of Flexbox: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="item">Item 1</div>
        <div class="item">Item 2</div>
        <div class="item">Item 3</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Flexbox and Grid are both CSS features and are primarily used for layout purposes in web development.
They are part of the CSS specification and are implemented and used directly within HTML and CSS code.

While HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, CSS is responsible for styling and layout.
Flexbox and Grid are powerful CSS layout systems that allow you to create flexible and responsive designs.

In this example, we have an HTML file that references an external CSS file (`styles.css`).
The HTML file contains a container element (`div` with the class `.container`) and three item elements (`div` with the class `.item`).
The CSS file defines the styling for these elements.

In the CSS, we set the `.container` class to have `display: flex;`, which enables Flexbox layout for the container.
We also use `justify-content: center;` to horizontally center the items within the container.

The `.item` class defines the styling for the item elements. They have a fixed width and height, a background color, and some margin.
Similar to the container, the items also use Flexbox with `justify-content: center;` and `align-items: center;`
 to center their content both horizontally and vertically.

By combining HTML and CSS in this way, the Flexbox layout is applied to the container and its child items,
 resulting in a layout where the items are centered horizontally and vertically within the container.

Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS code to experiment with different layouts and styles using Flexbox! -->
