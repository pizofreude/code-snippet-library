// This is Java code that defines a class with a main method that prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

// The `public` keyword indicates that the class is visible and accessible from outside the package.

// The `class` keyword is used to define a new class.

// The name of the class is `HelloWorld`.

// The `main` method is the entry point of the program.

// It is declared as `public static void`, which means it can be called from outside the class without creating an instance of the class.

// The `String[] args` parameter is an array of command-line arguments.

// The `System.out.println` statement prints "Hello, world!" to the console.
